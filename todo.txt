		-create a tempate for a category page
		

	##so how do I store these in a DB?

-when you click on a genre -> it takes you to the category page
//this means when you click on the genre you retrive the data for the category page from the DB
	-- that is a list of categorys, images and their descriptions

-when you click on a category you retrive a reading list for that category
	-- that is a list of the books, images, the descriptions and the links
