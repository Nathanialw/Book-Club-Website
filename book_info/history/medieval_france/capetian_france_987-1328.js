  synopsis:
    "Capetian France 987–1328 is an authoritative overview of the country’s development across four centuries, with a focus on changes to the political, religious, social and cultural climate during this period.<br/><br/>When Hugh Capet took the throne of France in 987, his powers were weak and insignificant, but from an inauspicious beginning he founded a dynasty that was to last over 300 years and that came to dominate western Europe. This carefully updated third edition draws extensively on new scholarship that has emerged since the previous edition. It contains images, maps, family trees and a discussion of key sources, allowing the reader to develop a strong contextual knowledge as well as a greater connection with the material world of the period.<br/><br/>Maintaining a balance between a compelling narrative and an in-depth examination of central themes of the age, Capetian France 987–1328 provides a comprehensive account of this significant era within France’s history and is essential reading for all students of medieval France and Europe.",
