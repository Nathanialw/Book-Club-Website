  synopsis:
    "Sir Gawain and the Green Knight and Pearl are two poems by an unknown author written in about 1400. Sir Gawain is a romance, a fairy-tale for adults, full of life and colour; but it is also much more than this, being at the same time a powerful moral tale which examines religious and social values.<br/><br/>Pearl is apparently an elegy on the death of a child, a poem pervaded with a sense of great personal loss: but, like Gawain it is also a sophisticated and moving debate on much less tangible matters.<br/>Sir Orfeo is a slighter romance, belonging to an earlier and different tradition. It was a special favourite of Tolkienâ€™s.",
