  synopsis:
    "Irving Fisher was an American economist, inventor, and social campaigner. He was one of the earliest American neoclassical economists, though his later work on debt deflation has been embraced by the Post-Keynesian school. As a student, Fisher had shown particular talent and inclination for mathematics, but he found that economics offered greater scope for his ambition and social concerns. His thesis, published by Yale in 1892 as 'Mathematical Investigations in the Theory of Value and Prices,' was a rigorous development of the theory of general equilibrium. When he began writing the thesis, Fisher had not been aware that Leon Walras and his continental European disciples had already covered similar ground. Nonetheless, Fisher's work was a very significant contribution and was immediately recognized and praised as first-rate by such European masters as Francis Edgeworth. Contains an preface written by Fisher for the 1925 edition published by Yale.",
