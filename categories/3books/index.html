          The Roman Republic (Latin: Rēs pūblica Rōmāna [ˈreːs ˈpuːblika
          roːˈmaːna]) was a state of the classical Roman civilization, run
          through public representation of the Roman people. Beginning with the
          overthrow of the Roman Kingdom (traditionally dated to 509 BC) and
          ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the Roman Empire, Rome's
          control rapidly expanded during this period—from the city's immediate
          surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world.
          <br />
          <br />
          Roman society under the Republic was primarily a cultural mix of Latin
          and Etruscan societies, as well as of Sabine, Oscan, and Greek
          cultural elements, which is especially visible in the Roman Pantheon.
          Its political organization developed, at around the same time as
          direct democracy in Ancient Greece, with collective and annual
          magistracies, overseen by a senate.[4] The top magistrates were the
          two consuls, who had an extensive range of executive, legislative,
          judicial, military, and religious powers. Even though a small number
          of powerful families (called gentes) monopolised the main
          magistracies, the Roman Republic is generally considered one of the
          earliest examples of representative democracy.[5][6] Roman
          institutions underwent considerable changes throughout the Republic to
          adapt to the difficulties it faced, such as the creation of
          promagistracies to rule its conquered provinces, or the composition of
          the senate.
          <br />
          <br />
          Unlike the Pax Romana of the Roman Empire, the Republic was in a state
          of quasi-perpetual war throughout its existence. Its first enemies
          were its Latin and Etruscan neighbours as well as the Gauls, who even
          sacked the city in 387 BC. The Republic nonetheless demonstrated
          extreme resilience and always managed to overcome its losses, however
          catastrophic. After the Gallic Sack, Rome conquered the whole Italian
          peninsula in a century, which turned the Republic into a major power
          in the Mediterranean. The Republic's greatest strategic rival was
          Carthage, against which it waged three wars. The Punic general
          Hannibal famously invaded Italy by crossing the Alps and inflicted on
          Rome two devastating defeats at Lake Trasimene and Cannae, but the
          Republic once again recovered and won the war thanks to Scipio
          Africanus at the Battle of Zama in 202 BC. With Carthage defeated,
          Rome became the dominant power of the ancient Mediterranean world. It
          then embarked on a long series of difficult conquests, after having
          notably defeated Philip V and Perseus of Macedon, Antiochus III of the
          Seleucid Empire, the Lusitanian Viriathus, the Numidian Jugurtha, the
          Pontic king Mithridates VI, the Gaul Vercingetorix, and the Egyptian
          queen Cleopatra.
          <br />
          <br />
          At home, the Republic similarly experienced a long streak of social
          and political crises, which ended in several violent civil wars. At
          first, the Conflict of the Orders opposed the patricians, the closed
          oligarchic elite, to the far more numerous plebs, who finally achieved
          political equality in several steps during the 4th century BC. Later,
          the vast conquests of the Republic disrupted its society, as the
          immense influx of slaves they brought enriched the aristocracy, but
          ruined the peasantry and urban workers. In order to address this
          issue, several social reformers, known as the Populares, tried to pass
          agrarian laws, but the Gracchi brothers, Saturninus, and Clodius
          Pulcher were all murdered by their opponents, the Optimates, keepers
          of the traditional aristocratic order. Mass slavery also caused three
          Servile Wars; the last of them was led by Spartacus, a skillful
          gladiator who ravaged Italy and left Rome powerless until his defeat
          in 71 BC. In this context, the last decades of the Republic were
          marked by the rise of great generals, who exploited their military
          conquests and the factional situation in Rome to gain control of the
          political system. Marius (between 105 and 86 BC), then Sulla (between
          82 and 78 BC) dominated in turn the Republic; both used extraordinary
          powers to purge their opponents.
          <br />
          <br />
          These multiple tensions led to a series of civil wars; the first
          between the two generals Julius Caesar and Pompey. Despite his victory
          and appointment as dictator for life, Caesar was assassinated in 44
          BC. Caesar's heir Octavian and lieutenant Mark Antony defeated
          Caesar's assassins Brutus and Cassius in 42 BC, but they eventually
          split up thereafter. The final defeat of Mark Antony alongside his
          ally and lover Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, and the
          Senate's grant of extraordinary powers to Octavian as Augustus in 27
          BC – which effectively made him the first Roman emperor – thus ended
          the Republic.
