          The Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945) was a military conflict that
          was primarily waged between the Republic of China and the Empire of
          Japan. The war made up the Chinese theater of the wider Pacific
          Theater of the Second World War. The beginning of the war is
          conventionally dated to the Marco Polo Bridge Incident on 7 July 1937,
          when a dispute between Japanese and Chinese troops in Peking escalated
          into a full-scale invasion. This full-scale war between the Chinese
          and the Empire of Japan is often regarded as the beginning of World
          War II in Asia.
          <br /><br />
          China fought Japan with aid from the Soviet Union, United Kingdom and
          the United States. After the Japanese attacks on Malaya and Pearl
          Harbor in 1941, the war merged with other conflicts which are
          generally categorized under those conflicts of World War II as a major
          sector known as the China Burma India Theater. Some scholars consider
          the European War and the Pacific War to be entirely separate, albeit
          concurrent, wars. Other scholars consider the start of the full-scale
          Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937 to have been the beginning of World
          War II. The Second Sino-Japanese War was the largest Asian war in the
          20th century. It accounted for the majority of civilian and military
          casualties in the Pacific War, with between 10 and 25 million Chinese
          civilians and over 4 million Chinese and Japanese military personnel
          missing or dying from war-related violence, famine, and other causes.
          The war has been called "the Asian holocaust."
          <br /><br />
          The war was the result of a decades-long Japanese imperialist policy
          to expand its influence politically and militarily in order to secure
          access to raw material reserves, food, and labor. The period after
          World War I brought about increasing stress on the Japanese policy.
          Leftists sought universal suffrage and greater rights for workers.
          Increasing textile production from Chinese mills was adversely
          affecting Japanese production and the Great Depression brought about a
          large slowdown in exports. All of this contributed to militant
          nationalism, culminating in the rise to power of a militarist faction.
          This faction was led at its height by the Hideki Tojo cabinet of the
          Imperial Rule Assistance Association under edict from Emperor
          Hirohito. In 1931, the Mukden Incident helped spark the Japanese
          invasion of Manchuria. The Chinese were defeated and Japan created a
          new puppet state, Manchukuo; many historians cite 1931 as the
          beginning of the war. From 1931 to 1937, China and Japan continued to
          skirmish in small, localized engagements, so-called "incidents".
          <br /><br />
          Following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, the Japanese scored major
          victories, capturing Beijing, Shanghai and the Chinese capital of
          Nanjing in 1937, which resulted in the Rape of Nanjing. After failing
          to stop the Japanese in the Battle of Wuhan, the Chinese central
          government was relocated to Chongqing (Chungking) in the Chinese
          interior. Following the Sino-Soviet Treaty of 1937, strong material
          support helped the Nationalist Army of China and the Chinese Air Force
          continue to exert strong resistance against the Japanese offensive. By
          1939, after Chinese victories in Changsha and Guangxi, and with
          Japan's lines of communications stretched deep into the Chinese
          interior, the war reached a stalemate. While the Japanese were also
          unable to defeat the Chinese communist forces in Shaanxi, who waged a
          campaign of sabotage and guerrilla warfare against the invaders, they
          ultimately succeeded in the year-long Battle of South Guangxi to
          occupy Nanning, which cut off the last sea access to the wartime
          capital of Chongqing. While Japan ruled the large cities, they lacked
          sufficient manpower to control China's vast countryside. In November
          1939, Chinese nationalist forces launched a large scale winter
          offensive, while in August 1940, Chinese communist forces launched a
          counteroffensive in central China. The United States supported China
          through a series of increasing boycotts against Japan, culminating
          with cutting off steel and petrol exports into Japan by June 1941.
          Additionally, American mercenaries such as the Flying Tigers provided
          extra support to China directly.
          <br /><br />
          In December 1941, Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor,
          and declared war on the United States. The United States declared war
          in turn and increased its flow of aid to China – with the Lend-Lease
          act, the United States gave China a total of $1.6 billion ($18.4
          billion adjusted for inflation). With Burma cut off it airlifted
          material over the Himalayas. In 1944, Japan launched Operation
          Ichi-Go, the invasion of Henan and Changsha. However, this failed to
          bring about the surrender of Chinese forces. In 1945, the Chinese
          Expeditionary Force resumed its advance in Burma and completed the
          Ledo Road linking India to China. At the same time, China launched
          large counteroffensives in South China and retook West Hunan and
          Guangxi. Japan formally surrendered on 2 September 1945. China was
          recognized as one of the Big Four Allies during the war, regained all
          territories lost to Japan and became one of the five permanent members
          of the United Nations Security Council.
