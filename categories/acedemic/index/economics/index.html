          Economics focuses on the behaviour and interactions of economic agents
          and how economies work. Microeconomics is a field which analyzes
          what's viewed as basic elements in the economy, including individual
          agents and markets, their interactions, and the outcomes of
          interactions. Individual agents may include, for example, households,
          firms, buyers, and sellers. Macroeconomics analyzes the economy as a
          system where production, consumption, saving, and investment interact,
          and factors affecting it: employment of the resources of labour,
          capital, and land, currency inflation, economic growth, and public
          policies that have impact on these elements.<br /><br />
          Other broad distinctions within economics include those between
          positive economics, describing "what is", and normative economics,
          advocating "what ought to be"; between economic theory and applied
          economics; between rational and behavioural economics; and between
          mainstream economics and heterodox economics.
